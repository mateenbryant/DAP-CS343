    <h2>DAP Report by Mateen Faieq</h2>
    <h3>phase1:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the url to my github repo which is shared with Professor Stewart <a href="https://github.com/mateenbryant/DAP-CS343"><u>here</u></a>.</li>
    <li>I have published the site on w3stu at the following link <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/faieqma/cs343/DAP-CS343/">here</a></li>
    <li>this is report.html within the root directory of my site.</li>
    <li>I have a total of 5 different pages: The home page (index.html),
      shopping guide page, weather report page, rider profile page, and gear breakdown page.
    </li>
    <li>Each page contains the same header for the entire web application</li>
    <li>The header itself contains navigation links to each different page on the website</li>
    <li>My home page supports distinct devices with small screens. When the width of the window is decreased, the images 
      disappear, rather than showing images in a non-organized format.
    </li>
    <li>Each image has its own unique 'alt' description for users who would not be able to render images on any of the pages.</li>
    <li>All .html files do not contain any Nu Validator warnings or errors. However, i did not get the chance to validate the styling of the pages using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.</li>
    <li>The headers on all pages of my site use sans-serif font, while all other text on the site uses serif font.</li>
    <li>My slope weather page contains a form where you can search for a specific mountain
      (I plan on including a lot more mountains to make it more useful)
    </li>
    <li>There are numerous links to famous snowboarders' social media accounts and the project github repo itself.</li>
    <li>I have comments on my slope weather page about how i plan to use two different network requests on that page.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>phase2:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>i use an explicit media query for my css file in the home page. (homestyle.css)</li>
  <li>I use multiple types of bootstrap widgets, such as interactive blog cards, input forms on the weatherpage, and a navbar in the header.</li>
  <li>my blog page uses localStorage and follows the principles of CRUD entirely</li>
  <li>You can download the data from localStorage in the blog page.</li>
  <li>You can clear the data from localStorage in the blog page.</li>
  <li>I did not validate my pages and stylesheets, had too much work in other classes.</li>
</ol>
