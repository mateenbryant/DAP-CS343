    <h2>DAP Report by Mateen Faieq</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>This is the url to my github repo which is shared with Professor Stewart <a href="https://github.com/mateenbryant/DAP-CS343"><u>here</u></a>.</li>
    <li>I have published the site on w3stu at the following link <a href="https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/faieqma/cs343/DAP-CS343/">here</a></li>
    <li>this is report.html</li>
    <li>I have a total of 5 different pages: The home page (index.html),
      shopping guide page, weather report page, rider profile page, and gear breakdown page.
    </li>
    <li>Each page contains the same header for the entire web application</li>
    <li>The header itself contains navigation links to each different page on the website</li>
    <li>My home page supports distinct devices with small screens. When the width of the window is decreased, the images 
      disappear, rather than showing images in a non-organized format.
    </li>
    <li>IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS</li>
    <li>VALIDATION!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li>My sloper weather page contains a form where you can search for a specific mountain
      (I plan on including a lot more mountains to make it more useful)
    </li>
    <li>There are links to famous snowboarders' social media accounts and the project github repo itself.</li>
    <li>I have comments on my slope weather page about how i plan to use two different network requests on that page.</li>
