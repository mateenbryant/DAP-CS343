        <h3>Snowboard</h3>
        <p>Purpose: Your primary equipment, the snowboard, is what you'll be riding down the slopes.</p>
        <p>Importance: The snowboard's design, length, and flex play a significant role in determining speed, maneuverability, and the type of terrain it's best suited for. Whether you're a freestyle rider, an alpine enthusiast, or a powder hound, there's a board tailored for your style.</h3>

        <h3>Snowboard Boots</h3>
        <p>Purpose: These specialized boots connect you to your snowboard through the bindings.</p>
        <p>Importance: A good fit ensures comfort, warmth, and efficient power transfer to the board. The stiffness of the boot can influence control; softer boots are better for freestyle, while stiffer boots cater to freeriders and alpinists.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Bindings</h3>
        <p>Purpose: Bindings secure your boots to the snowboard.</p>
        <p>Importance: The right bindings provide a seamless connection between rider and board, allowing for precise control. They come in different styles, like strap-in or step-in, and their flex varies to complement riding styles.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Snowboard Helmet</h3>
        <p>Purpose: Safety first! A helmet protects your head from potential impacts.</p>
        <p>Importance: Aside from obvious safety benefits, modern helmets are lightweight, comfortable, and often come with added features like built-in audio. Helmets can also help retain heat, keeping you warm on colder days.</p>

        <div class="gear-images">
            <img src="images/goggles-image.jpg">
        </div>

        <h3>Goggles</h3>
        <p>Purpose: Goggles shield your eyes from snow, wind, and UV rays.</p>
        <p>Importance: Proper vision is essential when navigating slopes. Goggles with the right lens can enhance contrast and clarity, helping riders spot changes in terrain and conditions. Anti-fog features ensure clear vision, even on challenging weather days.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Snowboarding Jacket & Pants</h3>
        <p>Purpose: Protective outerwear designed to keep you warm and dry.</p>
        <p>Importance: Good snowboarding apparel is waterproof, windproof, and breathable. It ensures you stay comfortable, allowing moisture from sweat to escape while preventing snow and water from getting in. Look for gear with adequate insulation and venting options.</p>
